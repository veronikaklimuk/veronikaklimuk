### About me:
---
Hi there! üëãüèª

I'm Veronika, a London-based Data Analyst, adept at transforming complex data into actionable insights and strategic guidance.

At Wargaming, I have researched and refined the A/B testing framework, leading to a significant improvement in experimentation processes. My contributions, including conducting robustness analyses and implementing variance reduction techniques, have accelerated experimentation speed by 33%. Additionally, I've optimised the metrics calculation ETL pipeline, and supported strategic decision-making through comprehensive A/B test analyses and ad-hoc data insights.

Currently I'm actively seeking to join a team in London or remotely in the UK to work on great products and further utilise my data analysis capabilities. So if you have opportunities that align with my skills, I'd love to hear from you.

Other than that, feel free to reach out to me. I am always eager to connect with like-minded individuals in the field.

### Tableau:
---
Here you can have a look at dashboards I've created and main requirements to them.

üìä [Dash-1 Employee Satisfaction Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/veronika.klimuk/viz/EmployeeSatisfactionAnalysis_16606779496840/EmployeeSatisfactionAnalysis) 

The main objective of the project was to provide insights on employee satisfaction to the business stakeholders. 

To do that I conducted a meeting and collected all dashboard requirements. During the call I sticked to the 5Ws method to get in-depth understanding of the problem so that the dashboard meets all business needs. 

So here is a brief summary:
1. **Who** are the main users of the dashboard? HR Department Manager and Analysts. 
2. **What** questions should the dashboard answer? 
    - What is the overall level of employee satisfaction?
    -  How does the level of satisfaction vary by departments and job roles?
    - What are employee key indicators? (Analysts want to be able to go straight to employee profile pages)
    - Is there any correlation between level of satisfaction and such factors as salary and standstill?
3. **When** would the dashboard be used? Mostly once a quarter.
4. **Where** would the dashboard be used? On laptops; the dashboard size should be 16:9 so that Analysts could copy-paste it to their presentations. There is also a need to have a phone version. 
5. **Why** do users need it? The key objective is to prevent employee burnout. To do this, a survey is conducted, where employees indicate their degree of satisfaction, assess work environment and work-life balance. Based on the data obtained a further analysis is carried out.

üìä [Dash-2 BI and Data Analysts Market Overview](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/veronika.klimuk/viz/BIandDataAnalystsMarketOverview/BIandDataAnalystsMarketOverview#1)

This dashboard was created to monitor labor market trends in the Data Analysis field. 

The **main aim** is to cover the following questions:
- How many open vacancies are out there?
- What is the average salary? What is the salary range? 
- Which skills are the most requested at the moment?
- What is the general trend? Is there any seasonality?
    
There are **3 main categories of users** who may find this dashboard useful:
- Candidates looking for a new job, whose goal is to find most recent vacancies and their description; 
- Candidates not looking for a new job, whose goal is to track in-demand skills in order to stay competitive;
- Recruiters, whose goal is to analyze their open requests contrasted to the market and to stay updated on alike requests.
