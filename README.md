### Tableau:
---
Here you can have a look at dashboards I've created and main requirements to them.

üìä [Dash-1 Employee Satisfaction Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/veronika.klimuk/viz/EmployeeSatisfactionAnalysis_16606779496840/EmployeeSatisfactionAnalysis) 

The main objective of the project was to provide insights on employee satisfaction to the business stakeholders. 

To do that I conducted a meeting and collected all dashboard requirements. During the call I sticked to the 5Ws method to get in-depth understanding of the problem so that the dashboard meets all business needs. 

So here is a brief summary:
1. **Who** are the main users of the dashboard? HR Department Manager and Analysts. 
2. **What** questions should the dashboard answer? 
    - What is the overall level of employee satisfaction?
    -  How does the level of satisfaction vary by departments and job roles?
    - What are employee key indicators? (Analysts want to be able to go straight to employee profile pages)
    - Is there any correlation between level of satisfaction and such factors as salary and standstill?
3. **When** would the dashboard be used? Mostly once a quarter.
4. **Where** would the dashboard be used? On laptops; the dashboard size should be 16:9 so that Analysts could copy-paste it to their presentations. There is also a need to have a phone version. 
5. **Why** do users need it? The key objective is to prevent employee burnout. To do this, a survey is conducted, where employees indicate their degree of satisfaction, assess work environment and work-life balance. Based on the data obtained a further analysis is carried out.

üìä [Dash-2 BI and Data Analysts Market Overview](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/veronika.klimuk/viz/BIandDataAnalystsMarketOverview/BIandDataAnalystsMarketOverview#1)

This dashboard was created to monitor labor market trends in the Data Analysis field. 

The **main aim** is to cover the following questions:
- How many open vacancies are out there?
- What is the average salary? What is the salary range? 
- Which skills are the most requested at the moment?
- What is the general trend? Is there any seasonality?
    
There are **3 main categories of users** who may find this dashboard useful:
- Candidates looking for a new job, whose goal is to find most recent vacancies and their description; 
- Candidates not looking for a new job, whose goal is to track in-demand skills in order to stay competitive;
- Recruiters, whose goal is to analyze their open requests contrasted to the market and to stay updated on alike requests.
