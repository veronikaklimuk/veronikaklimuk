### About me:
---
Hi there! üëãüèª

My name is Veronika, I'm an aspiring Product Analyst with proven experience in Operational and Financial Analytics. 

Since February 2018 I work as a Business Operations Analyst at IBA Group, being responsible for analyzing operational and financial data and creating solution oriented reports. 

Having ~5 years of experience, and background knowledge in mathematics and statistics, I became interested in analysing not only operational and financial but complex data, finding correlations and looking for telltale trends. 

Currently I'm taking an extensive course to master at Python, SQL, git, Tableau, Airflow. As the course ends, I‚Äôll be looking for a Data Analyst/ Product Analyst position. So if you or your company is hiring, please feel free to contact me. 

I'm always happy to connect with like-minded and passionate people.

### Tableau:
---
Here you can have a look at dashboards I've created and main requirements to them.

üìä [Dash-1 Employee Satisfaction Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/veronika.klimuk/viz/EmployeeSatisfactionAnalysis_16606779496840/EmployeeSatisfactionAnalysis) 

The main objective of the project was to provide insights on employee satisfaction to the business stakeholders. 

To do that I conducted a meeting and collected all dashboard requirements. During the call I sticked to the 5Ws method to get in-depth understanding of the problem so that the dashboard meets all business needs. 

So here is a brief summary:
1. **Who** are the main users of the dashboard? HR Department Manager and Analysts. 
2. **What** questions should the dashboard answer? 
    - What is the overall level of employee satisfaction?
    -  How does the level of satisfaction vary by departments and job roles?
    - What are employee key indicators? (Analysts want to be able to go straight to employee profile pages)
    - Is there any correlation between level of satisfaction and such factors as salary and standstill?
3. **When** would the dashboard be used? Mostly once a quarter.
4. **Where** would the dashboard be used? On laptops; the dashboard size should be 16:9 so that Analysts could copy-paste it to their presentations. There is also a need to have a phone version. 
5. **Why** do users need it? The key objective is to prevent employee burnout. To do this, a survey is conducted, where employees indicate their degree of satisfaction, assess work environment and work-life balance. Based on the data obtained a further analysis is carried out.
