### About me:
---
Hi there! üëãüèª\
My name is Veronika, I'm an aspiring Product Analyst with proven experience in Operational and Financial Analytics. \
Since February 2018 I work as a Business Operations Analyst at IBA Group, being responsible for analyzing operational and financial data and creating solution oriented reports. \
Having ~5 years of experience, and background knowledge in mathematics and statistics, I became interested in analysing not only operational and financial but complex data, finding correlations and looking for telltale trends. \
Currently I'm taking an extensive course to master at Python, SQL, git, Tableau, Airflow. As the course ends, I‚Äôll be looking for a Data Analyst / Product Analyst position. So if you or your company is hiring, please feel free to contact me. \
I'm always happy to connect with like-minded and passionate people.
